Reddit-url: Try to find alternative to this one... **Producthunt**, **Hackernews**, or something else

Snapchat:
Crunchbase:

Most of the tweets are about fintech
The articles are high quality
FT has two of the best fintech sources
People are teachers

Launch strategy --
Ask a 3 people for feedback on who they follow.
Talk to those people and see who they follow.
Study Product Hunt -- for lists, create your own list, fintech people, and people who upvote a lot
Work on Twitter -- need to setup lists of people, start retweeting some items
